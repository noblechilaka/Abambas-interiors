# UX Improvements Implementation

## Steps to Complete

- [x] PRODUCT CATEGORIES: Add hover effects (image zoom 1.03x, label slide up, cursor change) via CSS
- [x] COMPLETED PROJECTS: Switch to alternating layout (image left/text right, flip), add subtle parallax, ensure CTA is "View Project"
- [x] CTA Section: Increase vertical spacing, add "We respond within 24 hours" reassurance line, enhance button hover with scale + shadow
- [x] CONTACT/MAP: Reduce map height, improve contact clarity (prominent address/phone/email), make icons subtle
- [x] RESPONSIVE: Implement mobile rules (no sticky except design process, max image height 60vh, swipeable lists, 44px tap targets, 30% reduced animations)
